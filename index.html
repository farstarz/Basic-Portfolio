            <p class="article">I am Vaibhav Pandey ( When you are done tying you can also call me Ilu). I am a Science major who loves Designing.<br><br>
                My life always revolved around two things understanding how things work and doing something creative. 
                Even when I pursued Electrical Engineering for my Bachelors and Masters to satisfy my first need I 
                was always involved in creative activities from decorating walls, photography, dancing or small 
                things like creative gift wrapping. After working as Automation Engineer for more than two year I 
                realized the part of automation that I enjoyed the most was screen designing (HMI Designing) and so I 
                decided to pursue Web designing full time. Hope you like what you see here.
